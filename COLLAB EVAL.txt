This demonstration contains three (or four) different prompts:• Visualizer extensions by ZhenyangPan & me:Basically our code is robust and very easy to use as reflected by other groups. Details contained in the group evaluations• Meshed Mass-Spring developed by Tian Lan & Xide Xia :Tian Lan and Xide Xia developed an excellent and cool Meshed Mass-Spring. We obtained their code from Piazza and communicated with them frequently. Their code is very easy to use and well adapted to our code. The wind force and the ball both work quite awesome. We collaborated with Tian Lan & Xide Xia a lot too and they helped us understanding their code as well as with merging their code with other groups.Some minor limitations: The properties of the two balls are hard to determine. That is, we need to try different combinations in the main function of value “K”, amount of air inside the ball, and value “b”, the pressure outside the ball, to determine the softness of the two balls almost iteratively. • Collision Detection Extension + Morton Code by Lukas & Erik:Lukas and Erik developed a robust Collision Detector. We obtained the code through Piazza and we have not communicated with Lukas or Erik in person. It is really awesome that their code integrates the Morton Code, for we previously tried collision detector of another group and the one developed by Lukas and Erik is much faster.However, there is a bug that both my group and other groups found: when the object is very small or very large in terms of distance between two nodes, either the collision cannot be detected or the program fails.
