Contributions of my partner and me
\b0 :\
My partner Zhenyang Pan and me communicated and  collaborated together throughout the whole project. While I am a bit more concentrated on the mathematical model part and he is a bit more concentrated on the data structure part, we generally do things together from the initial trials to the final implementations and report writing. I learned a lot advanced low-level programming knowledge from my partner Zhenyang Pan, and he is very responsible.\

\b Interaction with other teams
\b0 :\
We interacted with several other teams, including 
\f1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Meshed Mass-Spring team (Tian Lan & Xide Xia), Collision Detection (Yuna & Sabrina), Shallow Water team (Miruna & Wenwan Yang; Wenshuai Ye & Yuhao Zhu). We tried the codes with each other. Finally, we chose to merge with Meshed Mass-Spring team (Tian Lan & Xide Xia) and Collision Detection (Eric & Lukas) due to the robustness of Tian Lan & Xide Xia\'92s code and the Morton Code contained in Eric & Lukas\'92 code. We haven\'92t communicated with Eric & Lukas much. We collaborated with Tian Lan & Xide Xia a lot and they helped us understanding their code as well as merging with other groups.
