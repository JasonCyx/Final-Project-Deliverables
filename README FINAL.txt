1. Getting the package:
• Download the “CS207FinalProject.zip” from:  https://github.com/JasonCyx/Final-Project-Deliverables  and unzip the CS207FinalProject.zip file

2. To run the code in terminal:

• Change the directory to “CS207FinalProject”• $ make two_balls_collision• $ ./two_balls_collision data/sphere200* data/sphere200*


3. Interesting features to try:

• RightClick: Pause/ Unpause the simulation• Keyboard f: Activate/ Increase external wind force to the pass-in object• Keyboard m: Propel internal speed to the pass-in object• Keyboard UP: Accelerate the simulation (Cannot accelerate too much due to limitation of meshed mass spring)• Keyboard DOWN: Decelerate the simulation• Keyboard LEFT: Recover the simulation to original simulation setting• Keyboard w (s): Moving the pass-in object along x-axis increase (decrease)• Keyboard d (a): Moving the pass-in object along y-axis increase (decrease)• Keyboard z (x): Moving the pass-in object along z-axis increase (decrease)• Keyboard number key 1 2 3: Changing different colors for the pass-in object
